# Simple Test Score Predictor

This project implements a basic linear regression model to predict student test scores based on the number of hours studied. It’s a straightforward example meant to demonstrate how linear regression works using a small dataset.

## Overview

- The model uses 13 data points with two variables: hours studied and corresponding test scores.
- The data is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.
- A `LinearRegression` model is trained and evaluated using the R² score.
- A plot visualizes the relationship between hours studied and predicted scores.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Purpose

This project was my introduction to machine learning models. I learned to:
- Build a simple regression model
- Interpret an R² score
- Visualize model performance
